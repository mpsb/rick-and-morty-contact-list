# Rick and Morty Contact List

I created a contact list / search tool for users to find information on any Rick and Morty character: http://rick-and-morty-contact-list.vercel.app/

This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and makes API calls to the [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/) to search and display information.

## Dev Setup

1. `npm install` to install all required libraries and dependencies.
2. `npm start` to run the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
3. `npm test` to launch the test runner.
